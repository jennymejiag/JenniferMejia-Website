        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanish Teacherüçé</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennifer Mejia and I‚Äôm 20 years old. I‚Äôm currently a Spanish major at the University of California, Riverside. I‚Äôm a sophomore but my plan is to try to graduate in about 3 years. My passion for teaching Spanish stems from my heritage and close knit family upbringing. My parents are immigrants that came to the United States from Mexico. They came to the United States with nothing and were able to build a family. My parents inspired me to go to college and have a better future. I am also motivated by powerful women to make a name for myself. I did not want to become a housewife or depend on a partner. I believe that everyone has the potential to make their dreams a reality.My schedule has gotten in the way of a potential job opportunity, but if all goes well during spring quarter I intend to work at my old highschool as an AVID tutor. I plan on building a name for myself so that when I get my teaching credential I can go back to the highschool I attended and give back to my community. <br><br>

        I am currently getting experience of teaching by helping my little sister out with her homework. Through this experience I have gained plenty of patience which is essential when working with others. I have also learned how to manage my time since I have to make time to help her out with her homework while also making time to do my own homework. In highschool I was president of a club called Hermanos Unidos, a spanish heritage club in which we learned about our culture and made events like toy drives for a children‚Äôs hospital possible.<br><br>

        When I took Spanish in high school the classroom environment made me feel comfortable and safe. I aspire to bring my future students that same experience that made me excited to go to school. I want to not only encourage my students to learn spanish to recieve a good grade in the class, but also plan to keep Spanish in their lives even after high school. I want to be the mentor I wish I had during that difficult transition between middle school and college. High school is a difficult time in a young adult's life. People are still figuring out life. My dream is to encourage students to pursue a higher education and go to college. I aspire to encourage my students to pursue a professional career so that they have a better life. It is important to stand out when applying for jobs these days, being bilingual can set people apart and determine who gets a job. Eventually I would also like to become an ASB coordinator to make high school memorable for students. I was in ASB my senior year of high school and I loved it so much. Getting to put events together for the school taught me alot about teamwork and leadership skills. I look foward tobecoming a Spanish teacher and inspiring future generations.
